# Solar Feature Contour Tracking

A Python framework for tracking, segmenting, and analysing evolving solar
features (sunspots and pores) using contour-based methods.

The code is intended for **scientific workflows**, with an emphasis on

- reproducibility,
- clear separation of concerns, and
- publication-quality visualisation.

This repository accompanies ongoing research and is primarily designed for
expert users working with solar image data.

---

## Main features

- Contour-based tracking of evolving solar features
- Phase segmentation (forming / stable / decaying)
- Statistical analysis of physical and geometrical quantities
- Modular plotting pipelines:
  - snapshot figures,
  - PDFs,
  - animations.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sirrah91/solar-feature-contour-tracking.git
cd solar-feature-contour-tracking
```

---

### 2. Create a Python environment (recommended)

Using conda:

```bash
conda create -n contour python=3.11
conda activate contour
```

---

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should list **exact package versions** to ensure
reproducibility.

## Required data and configuration

This code **does not download data automatically**.

You are expected to provide:

- calibrated solar image data (e.g. FITS files),
- metadata required for tracking and statistics,
- configuration paths inside the scripts or via a user-defined config file.

Please inspect and modify the configuration file in `src/config/paths.py` to match your local data layout.

## Quick start


Run contour tracking via the main pipeline script:


```bash
python run_contour_tracking.py --data_dir /path/to/fits --contour_quantity Ic --penumbra_threshold 0.9 --umbra_threshold 0.5 --pore_threshold 0.65
```


Compute statistics:


```bash
python run_calc_stats.py --contour_file /path/to/contours/contour_file.npz --quantities Ic --stat_types sunspots
```


Segment the temporal evolution into distinct phases


```bash
python run_split_to_phases.py --contour_dirname /path/to/contours --mode sunspots
```


The pipeline script is designed to be configured via command-line arguments
and parameter files. It can be edited, wrapped, or extended for specific
datasets and experiments.

- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- matplotlib
